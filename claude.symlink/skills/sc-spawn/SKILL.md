name: sc-spawn
description: Break complex tasks into coordinated subtasks with efficient execution. Use when handling large multi-step tasks, orchestrating parallel work, or managing dependencies.

# Task Orchestration

Decompose complex requests into manageable subtasks and coordinate their execution.

## When to use

- Breaking down complex multi-step tasks
- Orchestrating parallel work streams
- Managing task dependencies
- Coordinating large-scale changes
- Executing batch operations efficiently

## Instructions

### Usage

```
/sc:spawn [task] [--sequential|--parallel] [--validate]
```

### Arguments

- `task` - Complex task or project to orchestrate
- `--sequential` - Execute tasks in dependency order (default)
- `--parallel` - Execute independent tasks concurrently
- `--validate` - Enable quality checkpoints between tasks

### Execution

1. Parse request and create hierarchical task breakdown
2. Map dependencies between subtasks
3. Choose optimal execution strategy (sequential/parallel)
4. Execute subtasks with progress monitoring
5. Integrate results and validate completion

### Claude Code Integration

- Uses TodoWrite for task breakdown and tracking
- Leverages file operations for coordinated changes
- Applies efficient batching for related operations
- Maintains clear dependency management
