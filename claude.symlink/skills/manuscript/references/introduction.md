# Introduction: Building the Case

## The Inverted Triangle — Done Right

Everyone knows Introduction narrows from broad to specific. But most writers start too broad.

### Don't Start Here

> "Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide."

Reviewers have read this sentence ten thousand times. It carries zero information.

### Start Here Instead

> "In the ICU, attending physicians routinely face a decision dilemma: is this patient's organ failure worsening or stabilizing? We currently lack an early, dynamic indicator to distinguish these two trajectories."

This drops the reader into a **specific unsolved problem** from sentence one. No background throat-clearing.

### The Rule

Your opening sentence should make a specialist in your field think: "Yes, that's a real problem I care about." If it would fit equally well in any paper in your field, it's too generic.

## Literature Review as Argumentation

Citations in the Introduction are **not** a literature review. They are premises in your argument. Every citation must serve one of three purposes:

| Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Establish importance** | "Delayed recognition of organ failure trajectories is associated with increased mortality (Chen 2019)" |
| **Expose prior limitations** | "Previous single-timepoint biomarker studies failed to capture disease dynamics (Smith 2020, Jones 2021)" |
| **Provide theoretical basis** | "Group-based trajectory modeling can identify latent subgroups with distinct longitudinal patterns (Nagin 2005)" |

### Bad: Citation Stacking

> Smith et al. (2020) studied X and found Y. Jones et al. (2021) studied A and found B. Wang et al. (2022) studied C and found D.

This is a list, not an argument.

### Good: Logical Chain

> Although multiple studies over the past decade have attempted to predict prognosis using single-timepoint biomarkers (Smith 2020, Jones 2021), these static measurements ignore the dynamic nature of disease progression. The few studies employing longitudinal designs (Wang 2022) captured change trends but were limited by sample size and follow-up duration, unable to identify clinically meaningful subgroups.

Each citation **advances** the argument toward "therefore, we need a new approach."

## The Gap Statement

The gap is the hinge of your entire paper. It must be:

- **Specific**: Not "more research is needed" but "no study has examined whether longitudinal biomarker trajectories independently predict short-term mortality"
- **Justified**: The preceding paragraphs must make the gap feel inevitable
- **Solvable**: Your study must clearly address this gap (or readers will wonder why you raised it)

## The Final Paragraph: Study Strategy

Most writers end with something vague:

> "This study aimed to explore the relationship between X and Y."

This tells the reader nothing they couldn't infer from the title.

### Better: State Your Exact Strategy

> "Using serial LDH measurements from N patients in [database], we employed group-based trajectory modeling to identify distinct biochemical change trajectories and examined whether these trajectories independently predicted 90-day mortality beyond traditional prognostic factors."

This gives the reader:

- **Data source** and sample
- **Analytical method**
- **Specific outcome**
- A mental map for reading Methods
