# Discussion: Deep Structure

## The Elevator Pitch (First Paragraph)

The opening paragraph of Discussion is the most important paragraph in your paper. It must do three things in 3–5 sentences:

1. **Summarize** the key finding (not all findings — the central one)
2. **Contextualize** it within the broader clinical or scientific picture
3. **Signal** why it matters

### Bad: Statistical Summary

> "In this study, we found that trajectory group 3 had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to groups 1 and 2 (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.8–3.2, p<0.001)."

This repeats a Results line. The reader already knows this.

### Good: Conceptual Significance

> "Our findings demonstrate that hospitalized patients' LDH trajectories can be classified into three distinct patterns, and the persistently rising trajectory independently predicted higher short-term mortality even after accounting for traditional risk factors. This suggests that the dynamic behavior of LDH carries prognostic information beyond what any single measurement can capture."

The reader immediately grasps the **conceptual leap**, not just the statistical result.

## The Interpretive Framework (Middle Paragraphs)

Don't compare your results to the literature study-by-study. Build a **coherent explanatory framework** in layers:

### Layer 1: Biological Mechanism

*Why* might your finding be true at a biological level?

> "The prognostic superiority of LDH trajectories over single measurements may reflect the dynamic balance between ongoing tissue damage and repair capacity. A persistently rising trajectory signals that damage outpaces repair — information lost in any single timepoint measurement. This is consistent with the known role of LDH as a marker of cellular turnover and tissue hypoxia (Author 2018)."

### Layer 2: Methodological Explanation

*Why* didn't previous studies find this?

> "Previous studies using single-timepoint LDH measurements (Smith 2020, Jones 2021) could not capture this dynamic information. Our use of group-based trajectory modeling allowed identification of latent subgroups with qualitatively different biochemical patterns, rather than forcing all patients onto a single average curve."

### Layer 3: Clinical Implication

*If true, so what?* How does this change practice?

> "If validated prospectively, serial LDH monitoring with trajectory classification could serve as an early warning system in ICU settings, enabling clinicians to identify deteriorating patients before clinical signs become apparent. The measurement is inexpensive, widely available, and requires no additional equipment."

### The Discipline

Each layer should reference supporting literature, but the literature serves **your argument** — you're not writing a mini review.

## Handling Inconsistent Results

When results don't match your hypothesis or the literature, do NOT:

- Ignore them
- Mention them and say "future research is needed"

Instead, **genuinely engage**:

### Framework for Inconsistencies

1. **State the inconsistency clearly**: "Contrary to our hypothesis, the transient-rise group did not show elevated mortality."
2. **Propose specific explanations**:
   - *Methodological differences*: "Unlike Wang (2022), who used weekly measurements, our daily measurements may have captured transient spikes that resolved."
   - *Population differences*: "Our cohort was younger (median 58 vs 67 years), potentially with greater physiological reserve."
   - *New insight*: "This unexpected finding may indicate that trajectory *shape* matters more than peak values — a transient rise followed by decline signals effective treatment response."
3. **Acknowledge residual uncertainty**: "These explanations remain speculative and warrant prospective investigation."

Honest engagement with unexpected findings **increases** your paper's credibility.

## Limitations: Balanced, Not Self-Destructive

### The Purpose

Limitations show you are **clear-eyed**, not humble. The reader should finish this section thinking "they've thought about this carefully" — not "why did they bother publishing?"

### The Structure (for each major limitation)

1. **Acknowledge** the limitation
2. **Mitigate**: what you did to address it
3. **Contextualize**: how this compares to the field

### Example

> "As a retrospective study, our analysis is susceptible to selection bias. However, we included all consecutive admissions meeting inclusion criteria to minimize selection effects, and our sensitivity analysis excluding patients with fewer than three measurements yielded consistent results (eTable 3). This limitation is shared by all observational trajectory studies to date, and prospective validation is the logical next step."

### What NOT to Do

- List 8 limitations with no mitigation
- "A limitation is the retrospective design." (bare statement, no mitigation)
- "Despite these limitations..." → launch into grandiose conclusion (tonal whiplash)

## The Conclusion

### Avoid

- Restating all findings with p-values
- "More research is needed" as the final sentence
- Overclaiming: "This will revolutionize clinical practice"

### Aim For

A concise statement of **clinical or scientific implication**:

> "Serial LDH trajectory monitoring may provide a readily available, dynamic prognostic tool in ICU settings. Prospective studies should evaluate whether trajectory-guided clinical decisions improve patient outcomes."

This tells the reader: here's what this means for practice, and here's the natural next step.
