# Sentence-Level Craft

## Subject Choice Determines Impact

The subject of your sentence is the first thing the reader processes. Make it count.

### Passive → Active

| Weak (Passive) | Strong (Active) |
|----------------|-----------------|
| A statistically significant association was observed between LDH trajectory and mortality | LDH trajectory independently predicted mortality |
| It was found that patients in group 3 had higher rates of... | Patients in the persistent-climb group experienced... |
| An increase was noted in the biomarker levels | Biomarker levels rose |

### The Rule

Make your **research variable** or **clinical actor** the subject. Use verbs with directionality ("predicted", "increased", "differed") rather than passive placeholders ("was observed", "was found", "was noted").

### When Passive is Appropriate

- Methods section: "Blood samples were collected every 6 hours" (the agent doesn't matter)
- When the receiver truly matters more: "All patients were followed until death or discharge"

## The Power Positions: First and Last Sentences

Readers skim by reading the **first** and **last** sentence of each paragraph. Optimize these two positions.

### First Sentence = Topic Sentence

States the paragraph's **core claim**:

- "LDH trajectories outperformed single measurements in predicting 90-day mortality."
- ~~"We also performed additional analyses."~~ (no claim, just transition)

### Last Sentence = Conclusion or Bridge

Either wraps up the paragraph's point or connects to the next:

- "This dynamic information is precisely what single-timepoint studies miss." (conclusion)
- "Whether this biological mechanism translates to clinical utility depends on the feasibility of real-time trajectory monitoring." (bridge)
- ~~"Further research is warranted."~~ (empty)

### The Middle = Evidence

Supporting data, citations, and reasoning fill the middle. Readers who skim will still get the argument from topic sentences alone.

## Hedge Discipline

Hedging is necessary in science. Hedge stacking is not.

### One Hedge Per Claim

| Stacked (bad) | Clean (good) |
|---------------|-------------|
| It is possible that this may potentially suggest a tendency toward... | This suggests... |
| These findings might possibly indicate that there could be... | These findings indicate... |
| It could be argued that this potentially represents... | One possible explanation is... |

### Choose the Right Hedge

| Confidence Level | Hedge |
|-----------------|-------|
| Strong inference from your data | "These findings indicate..." |
| Reasonable inference | "This suggests..." |
| Speculation beyond your data | "One possible explanation is..." |
| Acknowledging alternatives | "Although we cannot rule out..." |

### Where to Hedge

- Discussion interpretations — yes
- Causal language in observational studies — yes
- Results section — no (state facts without hedging)
- Methods section — no (you did what you did)

## Eliminating Empty Adjectives

### The Offenders

- "Interestingly, we found that..."
- "Importantly, this suggests..."
- "It is noteworthy that..."
- "A novel finding was..."

### The Fix

If a finding is interesting, **show** the contrast or surprise directly:

| Empty | Vivid |
|-------|-------|
| Interestingly, LDH trajectory predicted mortality better than single values | LDH trajectory predicted mortality with an AUC of 0.82, compared to 0.64 for baseline measurement alone |
| Importantly, this suggests clinical relevance | This 25-percentage-point mortality difference exceeds the threshold typically considered clinically meaningful in ICU prognostication |

If you need to tell the reader something is interesting, your presentation hasn't made it interesting.

## Sentence Length and Variety

### The Rhythm

Vary sentence length. Three long sentences in a row exhaust the reader. A short sentence after two complex ones creates emphasis.

> "The persistent-climb trajectory was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in 90-day mortality, an association that persisted after adjustment for age, severity score, and comorbid conditions in the multivariable model. This effect was consistent across all pre-specified subgroups. **The trajectory, not the peak value, predicted death.**"

The short final sentence lands with impact.

### Target Length

- Average: 15–25 words per sentence
- Occasional long (30–35 words): for complex results with necessary detail
- Occasional short (5–10 words): for emphasis

## Transition Logic

### Between Paragraphs

Don't use mechanical transitions ("Furthermore", "Additionally", "Moreover" in sequence). Use **logical connectors** that show the relationship:

| Relationship | Connector |
|-------------|-----------|
| Builds on prior point | "Building on this..." / "This pattern extended to..." |
| Contrasts | "However..." / "In contrast..." / "Despite this..." |
| Explains | "This likely reflects..." / "One mechanism for..." |
| Narrows focus | "Within this group..." / "Focusing on..." |
| Widens lens | "Beyond our specific findings..." / "More broadly..." |

### Between Sections

Use the last sentence of a section to foreshadow the next, and the first sentence of the next section to pick up the thread.

## Numbers and Statistical Reporting

### Formatting Conventions

- Spell out numbers under 10 in text (except with units): "three groups", "5 mg"
- Use digits for all numbers in Results: "Group 1 (n=1,168)"
- Report exact p-values (p=0.003), not thresholds (p<0.05), except for very small values (p<0.001)
- Always pair effect estimates with confidence intervals

### Consistent Precision

- Percentages: one decimal (34.2%)
- Hazard/odds ratios: two decimals (HR 2.38)
- P-values: three decimal places (p=0.003)
- Keep precision consistent for each type throughout the manuscript

## Checklist

- [ ] Subjects are research variables or actors, not passive constructions
- [ ] Every paragraph's first sentence states its claim
- [ ] Every paragraph's last sentence concludes or bridges
- [ ] Maximum one hedge per claim
- [ ] No empty adjectives ("interesting", "important", "noteworthy", "novel")
- [ ] Sentence length varies (mix of short and long)
- [ ] Transitions show logical relationships, not just sequence
- [ ] Numbers formatted consistently throughout
- [ ] Effect estimates always paired with confidence intervals
