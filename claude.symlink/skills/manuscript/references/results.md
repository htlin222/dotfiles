# Results: The Narrative Art

## Forest First, Then Trees

Open Results with a bird's-eye view: overall sample characteristics and the direction of main findings. Then zoom in.

### Bad: Table 1 Narration

> "The mean age was 62 years, 58% were male, comorbidities included hypertension (34%), diabetes (22%), chronic kidney disease (15%), COPD (8%), heart failure (12%), prior stroke (4%), and peripheral artery disease (3%)..."

Half a page of numbers the reader can find in Table 1.

### Good: Targeted Overview

> "Among 2,847 ICU admissions, trajectory modeling identified three distinct LDH patterns: stable-low (41%), transient-rise (35%), and persistent-climb (24%). Groups differed markedly in baseline severity: the persistent-climb group had significantly higher APACHE II scores and more frequent multi-organ failure at admission (Table 1)."

This tells the reader **what matters** and points them to Table 1 for details.

### The Rule

In the text, only highlight baseline characteristics that are **directly relevant to your research question**. Let the table speak for itself on everything else.

## Organize by Research Questions, Not Analysis Order

Don't present results in the order you ran your analyses. Present them in the order that builds your argument.

### Recommended Structure

1. **Describe the main pattern** you identified (e.g., trajectory group shapes and characteristics)
2. **Report the primary association** (pattern → main outcome)
3. **Report adjusted results** (multivariable analysis)
4. **Report sensitivity analyses** and secondary outcomes

Each step strengthens the argument: "We found distinct patterns → these patterns predict the outcome → the association holds after adjustment → and it's robust to alternative assumptions."

## The Bright Line: No Interpretation in Results

Results presents **facts**. Discussion presents **meaning**.

### Violation Signals

If your Results section contains any of these phrases, you've crossed the line:

- "This suggests that..."
- "This may be because..."
- "One possible explanation..."
- "Consistent with our hypothesis..."
- "As expected..."

### Why This Matters

Separating observation from interpretation is the basic trust contract of scientific writing. When you mix them, the reader can't distinguish what you found from what you believe — and trust erodes.

### The Exception

Brief factual comparisons are acceptable: "The mortality rate in the persistent-climb group (38%) was nearly triple that of the stable-low group (13%)." This is a factual statement, not interpretation.

## Presenting Statistical Results

### Lead with the Effect, Not the P-Value

- "A statistically significant difference was found (p<0.001)"
- "The persistent-climb trajectory was associated with 2.4-fold higher mortality (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.8–3.2)"

### Include Precision

Always report confidence intervals alongside point estimates. A significant p-value without a CI tells the reader nothing about clinical magnitude.

### Absolute Numbers Matter

For clinical audiences, supplement relative measures with absolute numbers:

> "The 90-day mortality was 38% in the persistent-climb group versus 13% in the stable-low group (absolute difference 25 percentage points; HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.8–3.2)."

## Referencing Figures and Tables

### Reference by Finding, Not by Existence

- "Table 2 shows the results of the multivariable analysis."
- "After adjustment for age, severity, and comorbidities, the persistent-climb trajectory remained independently associated with mortality (aHR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5–2.9; Table 2)."

### Don't Narrate Figures

- "As shown in Figure 2, the Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrate that group 3 has lower survival than groups 1 and 2, with the curves separating around day 14..."
- "Survival curves diverged early, with separation evident by day 14 (Figure 2)."

## Checklist

- [ ] Opens with bird's-eye view, not Table 1 narration
- [ ] Text highlights only clinically relevant baseline differences
- [ ] Presentation order follows research questions
- [ ] Structure: pattern → primary association → adjusted → sensitivity
- [ ] No interpretation or speculation (no "suggests", "may be because")
- [ ] Effect estimates lead; p-values support
- [ ] Confidence intervals accompany all estimates
- [ ] Absolute numbers supplement relative measures for clinical outcomes
- [ ] Figures/tables referenced by finding, not by existence
