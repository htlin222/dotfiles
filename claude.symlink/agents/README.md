### Multi-Agent Workflows

These subagents work together seamlessly, and for more complex orchestrations, you can use the **[Claude Code Commands](https://github.com/wshobson/commands)** collection which provides 52 pre-built slash commands that leverage these subagents in sophisticated workflows.

```bash
# Feature development workflow
"Implement user authentication feature"
# Automatically uses: backend-architect → frontend-developer → test-automator → security-auditor

# Performance optimization workflow  
"Optimize the checkout process performance"
# Automatically uses: performance-engineer → database-optimizer → frontend-developer

# Production incident workflow
"Debug high memory usage in production"
# Automatically uses: incident-responder → devops-troubleshooter → error-detective → performance-engineer

# Network connectivity workflow
"Fix intermittent API timeouts"
# Automatically uses: network-engineer → devops-troubleshooter → performance-engineer

# Database maintenance workflow
"Set up disaster recovery for production database"
# Automatically uses: database-admin → database-optimizer → incident-responder

# ML pipeline workflow
"Build end-to-end ML pipeline with monitoring"
# Automatically uses: mlops-engineer → ml-engineer → data-engineer → performance-engineer

# Product launch workflow
"Launch new feature with marketing campaign"
# Automatically uses: business-analyst → content-marketer → sales-automator → customer-support
```

### Advanced Workflows with Slash Commands

For more sophisticated multi-subagent orchestration, use the companion [Commands repository](https://github.com/wshobson/commands):

```bash
# Complex feature development (8+ subagents)
/full-stack-feature Build user dashboard with real-time analytics

# Production incident response (5+ subagents) 
/incident-response Database connection pool exhausted

# ML infrastructure setup (6+ subagents)
/ml-pipeline Create recommendation engine with A/B testing

# Security-focused implementation (7+ subagents)
/security-hardening Implement OAuth2 with zero-trust architecture
```

## Subagent Format

Each subagent follows this structure:
```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: When this subagent should be invoked
model: haiku  # Optional - specify which model to use (haiku/sonnet/opus)
tools: tool1, tool2  # Optional - defaults to all tools
---

System prompt defining the subagent's role and capabilities
```

### Model Configuration

As of Claude Code v1.0.64, subagents can specify which Claude model they should use. This allows for cost-effective task delegation based on complexity:

- **Low Complexity (Haiku)**: Simple tasks like basic data analysis, documentation generation, and standard responses
- **Medium Complexity (Sonnet)**: Development tasks, code review, testing, and standard engineering work  
- **High Complexity (Opus)**: Critical tasks like security auditing, architecture review, incident response, and AI/ML engineering

Available models (using simplified naming as of Claude Code v1.0.64):
- `haiku` - Fast and cost-effective for simple tasks
- `sonnet` - Balanced performance for most development work
- `opus` - Most capable for complex analysis and critical tasks

If no model is specified, the subagent will use the system's default model.

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

Claude Code automatically coordinates agents using these common patterns:

### Sequential Workflows
```
User Request → Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Result

Example: "Build a new API feature"
backend-architect → frontend-developer → test-automator → security-auditor
```

### Parallel Execution
```
User Request → Agent A + Agent B (simultaneously) → Merge Results

Example: "Optimize application performance" 
performance-engineer + database-optimizer → Combined recommendations
```

### Conditional Branching
```
User Request → Analysis → Route to appropriate specialist

Example: "Fix this bug"
debugger (analyzes) → Routes to: backend-architect OR frontend-developer OR devops-troubleshooter
```

### Review & Validation
```
Primary Agent → Review Agent → Final Result

Example: "Implement payment processing"
payment-integration → security-auditor → Validated implementation
```

## Best Practices

### 🎯 Task Delegation
1. **Let Claude Code delegate automatically** - The main agent analyzes context and selects optimal agents
2. **Be specific about requirements** - Include constraints, tech stack, and quality requirements
3. **Trust agent expertise** - Each agent is optimized for their domain

### 🔄 Multi-Agent Workflows
4. **Start with high-level requests** - Let agents coordinate complex multi-step tasks
5. **Provide context between agents** - Ensure agents have necessary background information
6. **Review integration points** - Check how different agents' outputs work together

### 🎛️ Explicit Control
7. **Use explicit invocation for specific needs** - When you want a particular expert's perspective
8. **Combine multiple agents strategically** - Different specialists can validate each other's work
9. **Request specific review patterns** - "Have security-auditor review backend-architect's API design"

### 📈 Optimization
10. **Monitor agent effectiveness** - Learn which agents work best for your use cases
11. **Iterate on complex tasks** - Use agent feedback to refine requirements
12. **Leverage agent strengths** - Match task complexity to agent capabilities

## Contributing

To add a new subagent:
1. Create a new `.md` file following the format above
2. Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names
3. Write clear descriptions for when the subagent should be used
4. Include specific instructions in the system prompt

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent not being invoked automatically:**
- Ensure your request clearly indicates the domain (e.g., "performance issue" → performance-engineer)
- Be specific about the task type (e.g., "review code" → code-reviewer)

**Unexpected agent selection:**
- Provide more context about your tech stack and requirements
- Use explicit invocation if you need a specific agent

**Multiple agents producing conflicting advice:**
- This is normal - different specialists may have different priorities
- Ask for clarification: "Reconcile the recommendations from security-auditor and performance-engineer"

**Agent seems to lack context:**
- Provide background information in your request
- Reference previous conversations or established patterns

### Getting Help

If agents aren't working as expected:
1. Check agent descriptions in their individual files
2. Try more specific language in your requests
3. Use explicit invocation to test specific agents
4. Provide more context about your project and goals
