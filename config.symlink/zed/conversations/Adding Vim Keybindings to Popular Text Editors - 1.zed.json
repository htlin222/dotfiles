For example, `/now` to search for the word \"now\".\n\n4. **Navigate Search Results**:\n    - Press `Enter` to execute the search.\n    - Press `n` to move to the next occurrence of the search result.\n    - Press `N` to move to the previous occurrence.\n\n5. **Exit Search Mode**:\n    - Press `Esc` if you wish to cancel the current search.\n\n### Example Workflow\n\n1. **Start Vim or your editor with Vim keybindings**.\n2. **Switch to Normal mode (if not already in it)**:\n    - Press `Esc`.\n\n3. **Search for \"now\"**:\n    - Type `/now` and press `Enter`.\n\n4. **Cycle through results**:\n    - Press `n` to move to the next match of \"now\".\n    - Press `N` to move to the previous match.\n\n5. **Stop Searching**:\n    - Press `Esc`.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Case Insensitive Search**:\n    - Prefix the search with `\\c` to make it case insensitive. For example, `/\\cnow`.\n\n- **Search and Replace**:\n    - You can search and replace text using the `:s` command.\n    - For example, `:s/now/then/g` replaces \"now\" with \"then\" in the current line.\n    - To replace in the whole document, use `:%s/now/then/g`.\n\nThese simple commands should help you perform basic searches and navigate through your text efficiently.
